<h1>Visibility Project</h1>
An on going project used to clean and graph different sales data. 
<br>
The purpose of this project was to be able to quickly gather sales data from our limited sales system.

It allows us to download excel sheets that are cumbersome and time consuming to get need to know data from quickly.
