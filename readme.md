<h1>Visibility Project</h1>
An on going project used to clean and graph different sales data. 
<br>
<br>
The purpose of this project was to be able to quickly gather sales data from our limited sales system. 
<br>
<br>
It allows us to download excel sheets that are cumbersome and time consuming to get need to know data from quickly. 
<br>
<br>
This is an example of the view we have in the POS system to determine a products sales history.
